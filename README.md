## PROJECT: Thermo Simulation for Solar Water Heater

This simulation models the energy transferred from the sun to the water and how effective an insulated storage tank
maintains the previously heated water temperature. Running this simulation produces a GUI that outputs the size of area
to satisfy the input requirements. The next part of the GUI calculates the estimated water temperature after being left
in a given insulated tank. 

### Prerequisites

Download either executable file main_thermo_sim for linux users and main_thermo_sim.exe then run the file.

To run the source code locally the following python libraries are required:
1. NumPy
2. Tkinter

### Installation

For the NumPy library
    
    $ sudo apt install python-numpy

For the Tkinter library

    $ sudo apt-get install python3-tk
